			`   You push through the swinging doors of the Red Rock Saloon to find it's nearly deserted. The bartender briefly looks up from wiping down glasses and nods toward the back where Hroar is seated as usual.`
			`   The one other patron in the saloon, a man passed out on the bar, doesn't flinch as you walk past him to Hroar's waiting booth.`

				`   "What do you mean 'Long Haul'?"`
			`   Hroar strokes his handle bar mustache, "Think of it as an initiation of sorts. Without the Long Haul, there ain't no Haulers. It's our most lucrative run, and without it we'd be another tiny mom and pop outfit, or worse, we'd be Blue Caps, forced to work for the Transport Union."`

			label courier
			`   "Everyone who wants to be a Hauler, regardless of their place in the organization, has to do a Long Haul. It's that simple. Doesn't matter one lick how special you, or the work you'll be doing, are. The Long Haul is our life blood."`
			`   Hroar leans forward. "Don't fret too much. It's not like it used to be. Compared to the old days this is almost a milk run, assuming you have the cargo space."`
			`   He leans back and and smiles amblically. "Now, first off you need to pick up your logistics officer, to manage the Long Haul. For you, that'll be ol' Yngvar. He's waiting for you on <destination>. He just secured a deal for some Helium-3, so I am going to be sending 10 tons of it with you. Drop off the Helium-3, meet Yngvar in the spaceport, and head back here to get loaded up for the Long Haul."`
			`   "Pretty straightforward, and once we get this over with, I have a bunch more work for you. So hurry." Hroar points to the door, and you leave him to his booth.`

			`   The spaceport on Memory is a handful of unconnected, and hastily constructed buildings, that exist on the very edge of the concrete landing field where ships set down. The first few buildings you approach are locked. The next building's door swings open, but you find the inside of it dark and empty. On your forth try the door opens to a warehouse with a couple of startled people. They let you know, in annoyed tones, where the cantina can be found and suggest that you should head there.`
			`   The Cantina is a large, grey space, filled with cheap chairs and wobbly tables. There's a few automatic food vendors, and a few clumps of chattering people. You remove your respirator, and notice an old greying man, in a faded red hauler jacket walking toward you.`
			`   "Saw you set down an hour ago. Sure took your time gettin' here." The old man says with a gruff voice as he settlers in front of you. He's old, older than you realized, with deep creases crisscrossing his leathery scarred face. One of his eyes is milky white, and surrounded by vacuum burns that stretch into a thin hairline, and past the scarred slit that was once an ear. He lifts up his right hand, it covered with the tale-tell bubbles of severe radition damage, and offers it to you.`
			`   "Name's Yngvar." He looks at you hard with his one good eye.`
			choice
				`   (Shake his hand.)`

			`   He squeezes your hand a little harder and leans in, "I trust you can be relied upon to do just that?"`

				`   "Yeah. No problem for me."`
					goto noproblem
				`   "I can be relied upon to do whatever I want."`

			`   He releases your hand, straightens up, steps back, and gives you a cold smile.`

			`   The dusty, red saloon is awash in grimey captains, officers and crew members. At the center of the crush of bodies, is Hroar. He catches your eye as you enter and then he climbs on top of the bar.`
			`   "I reckon it's about time we get this show on the road." Hroar hollars, and the room immedatly quiets down.`
			`   "Now, as every rock-hopper 'tween here and the twice-cursed gap knows, we're fixing to go another Long Haul". A brief cheer rises from the crowded bar.` 
			`   "And everybody knows a Long Haul means we all get paid. So, let's make sure we get this done right."`
			`   Hroar pulls brass specticals out of his breast pocket and balances them on his nose. He then carefully unfolds a brown stained piece of paper and reads, "This here run will be headed by Captain <last>."`
			`   This news is followed by some unhappy grunts. "Now, now. Don't you fret over this greenhorn, he'll have ol' Yngvar on his ship to keep him in line." `
			`   Hroar continues, "Captain <last> will also escort Captain Unferth and his Red Ruin, Captain Boverka, and her ship the Iron Siren, and Captain Gunhilda's Fimbulvintr. Don't forget, Yngvar will be managing the fleet, materials and everything else. He's got the first word, and last, on any world and at any port you find yourselves in." `
			`   Hroar folds up the brown paper, and takes off his glases, and scans the crowd. "Haulers, you have your orders. May the Gap accept you, and the God-Stones watch over you. Now, get to your ships. It's time to haul.`

			`	Yngvar gives you a lopsided grin. "Think of it as part of the experience. An initiation, of sorts, and everyone likes to see the greenhorn running in circles. But worry not, you're with Yngvar now. And if you're wiling to listen, Yngvar is always willing to talk." He shrugs.`
					goto whatisthis

But what you do with them is on your head. Now is there anything you want to know, Captain, before we head off?"`

			`	"A right pertinent question." The grey spacer nods, "Our final destination, and ultimate goal is Lagrange Station in the Enif System. Long before Hroar was an egg in an infant's basket, the Long Haulers of Muspel have been making the Adhara-Enif run. In our day it's barely a milkrun, despite the distance, but in the past it was nothing to laugh about. Slower ships, hostile governments, dangerous mauraders, malfunctioning drives. It was the kind of run most traders balked at. But the Quarg, they pay good for a bulk run like this, and it's been our life blood ever since the first Hauler struck out generations ago."  `
			`	Yngvar gets a glossly look in his eye as he waxes about bygone space-ages, "Anyways, it's that top dollar that keeps us independent. Keeps us flush. Keeps the blue caps from absorbing us. But it's not the only stop. It'd be a waste of resources, time, and opportunity if we didn't make calls at other ports along the way. So we'll also be stopping at Earth, Chiron, and Wayfarer. Earth, in the Sol system, being our first stop." `
					goto whatisthis
			label escorts
			`	The old man strokes his grey-white beard, "Any hauler worth their dust knows its best to travel together, especially on a Long Haul. The other ships have some supplies intended for the primary destination in the Enif System, but they also have cargo and contracts for systems we will be passing through on our way to Enif. The Iron Siren will be dropping off basic humanitarian supplies on Earth, The Red Ruin is transporting guest workers from New Iceland, and the Fimbulvintr will be picking up supplies on Wayfarer. I'll get in more detail at each port, if you have more questions. It's all about maximizing profits, and protection."`
					goto whatisthis
			label gap
			`	"Ah, I sometimes forget you didn't come up on the red like the rest of us." He glances up toward the ceiling, as though he can see through it, past the weak athmosphere, and out into the black space beyond. "The Gap is just what we call the darkness between the Stars. Interstellar space. It comes from an old word, the Ginnungagap, the 'yawning gap', the primoridal darkness at the begining of time. Truth is, we hardly go there anymore, not like it was in my great-grandfather's time, not like it was with the Generation Ships. We flit from star to star, avoiding the true Gap. These days the Gap just means space in general. Anywhere beyond the atmosphere. But trust me, these star-lit islands where we huddle, they are nothing like the true Gap. Where dark horrors haunt."`
			`	His stern face gives way to a hint of mirth, "But don't you be worrying none about an old sailor's fables. You know why we call it the Gap, and what's more than most can say. We'll make you a red jacket yet." `
