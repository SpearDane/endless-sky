			`All around you off-world merchants haggle over the price of wool. A swirling cacophony of rising, falling, angry, hungry, sly, honeyed voices threading stories, pleas, and promises in hope of walking away from this sheep-covered world with a slightly better deal. They are all oblivious to the wider world around them, to the amber sunset, to the dancing motes of dust, to the gentle bleats beyond the shallow walls of this facility.`
			`	Now that you think about it, you notice something is off about a few of those gentle bleats. They sound hostile, angry, even dangerous. Just beyond the nearest exit something strange is going on, something unremarked and unnoticed by all the people around you.`
			choice

					goto investigate
				`	(Ignore the Noise.)`

			`	You push through the exit, and out into the rolling sheep filled fields of New Kansas. While there are pockets of trees and shrubbery, for much of the view you see nothing, but an endless expanse of grazing land covered in the aimless dots of sheep.`
			`	The noise that brought you out into this ebbing dusk is louder now, and quite near. Just beyond a few hedges you see a couple of red-eyed homicidal sheep, with oddly sharp fangs bared, growling and stamping at a huddled animal in a hole.`
			choice
				`	(Run and yell at the sheep.)`
					goto yelling

			`	For one terrifying instant the mad sheep hold their ground, and bare their oddly sharp fangs at you, but they hesitate, and then turn and flee.`

				`	(Shoo the dog away.)`
			`	Saga clearly wants to follow you, her savior, wherever you're headed. But after yelling at her a few times she finally drops are tail and slinks away into the shrubbery. Last thing you need is some lost mutt following you around. You ignore the sound of her low whimpers as you return to the spaceport.`

			`	Saga happily follows you inside the spaceport. No one seems to mind a mutt at your heels, and after a little searching you find an information kiosk. A man with tired eyes, and a wool vest stands within it.`
			choice
				`	(Inquire about the dog, and her possible owner.)`
			`	The man's eyes seem to sag as you speak. Your earnest words lulling him to sleep. Once you're done he frowns, and shakes his head slowly.`
			`	"Ser," he says with forced politeness, "this is a spaceport, not a shelter. We are aware of that stray dog. She has been prowling around for weeks. No one has come to collect her, and no one wants her. Frankly, we assumed the feral sheep would get to her by now. It would have done us all a favor.`
			` 	I am sorry she has distracted you, and is now wasting both our time. If you'd like you can leave her with me, and I'll take care of it." `

					goto refuse
				`	(Give the dog to the wool vested man.)`
			`	The man tries, and fails to smile. "Thank you. I will make sure this stray mutt bothers no one else in our future." He grabs her by her frayed collar, and drags her toward a nearby door. She struggles against him and whimpers, looking back at you, until at last she disappears behind a lifeless beige exit.`

I am sorry this could not have been a joyful occasion. You gave me my start, and I will never forget it, but perhaps you've changed more than I have. Good luck, and goodbye.`

And I do want you to know you changed my life. You made all of this possible, and you'll have a friend in me so long as I am breathing. Take care."`
			`	With that the doors behind you open back up, and you are led back outside to a waiting vehicle. You ride it in silence through the dust-thick landscape back to the dirty shabby spaceport where your ship, and your dog await.`

			`	Timothy beams, "Yes, yes, lovely! It'll be a great evening!" He stands up, a little quickly. "I'll make sure everything is perfect. Return to your ship, collect your wonderful canine, and be back here in about 8 hours!" `

				`	(Prepare for the party.)`
			`	Saga is thrilled to be leaving your ship. Despite being slower with age, her old mirth shines through. The lighter gravity seems to do her old bones good, as she watches the passing landscape with great intensity upon your return journey to the Governor's mansion.`
			`	The mansion is lit up with dozens of flood lights. An army of valets, waiters, and attendants weave in and out of the various rooms and halls. You and Saga are immediately ushered to a table of honor. You meet a half dozen company-bosses, senior executives, political operatives, and the like. You notice Regina here as well, but she is seated at a table in the back, on the fringes of the upper crust of society.`
			`	Saga is thrilled to see Timothy again. You weren't sure if she'd remember him, but clearly his brief stay aboard your ship left lasing impression. Her tail wags furiously, as she, forgetting her age, tries to jump up on him. To all this he laughs, pets her, and plies her with juicy treats.`
			`	Eventually, the party settles down and Timothy steps up to a podium. He launches into a speech highlighting your career. The great changes you have wrought, the battles you have won, the legends of your ship. The crowd eats it all up, many having heard of some, or all of these exploits. But then Timothy takes a more somber note. He talks quietly about the troubles on his old world. On how as a starving, homeless fugitive he had recklessly hidden aboard the first ship he could find. How you had found him, half dead, in an empty crate. And how, instead of tossing him out an airlock, or dropping off at the nearest world, you took him where he asked. How you took care of him, and how through your generosity, you had given him a second chance.`
			`	Light reflects off the tears that cling to Timothy's eyes as he tells the assembled crowd that, for him, that was your greatest moment, your most heroic action, that nothing you've done, or ever will do, compares to that simple act of mercy. And that this, to him, alone, is what makes you great.`
			`	The assembled guests stand, clap and cheer. They look at you, at your seat of honor, and hold up glasses in your honor. Saga, excited by the wild attention, barks happily. Eventually as the cheers and hoots die down, the Governor, declares you a Hero of Rand, and thanks you for your service.`

But, then you talk about how poor, dirty, and shabby things are outside of this mansion. With its fake gravity, and fake greenery. You declare you want no praise from them, no flattery, and no accolades. There's a million Heroes of Rand, outside these baroque walls, toiling away in dirty, dangerous mines. All for what? So that these company-bosses and fat-cat politicians can pat each other on the back and live obscene luxary in the middle of a squalid world? You rail, you rant, you break them down, and you turn the crowd against you. Angry people are shouting back at you now, boos and hisses are rising up from all sides of the room. And yet, you see a glimmer of respect in the eyes of servants. The waiters, the attendants, the assistants, they clench their fists and nod as your speech goes on. They hear you. They agree with you. A plate crashes into the podium. Another slams into the pillar nearby you. The crowd bulging toward you. The esteemed guests with murder in their eyes.`
			`	Before you have time to act, Timothy and his assistant have whisked you away from the angry crowd of the world's elites. Timothy, unhappy with your words, but still believing he owes you a debt, helps you and Saga get into an unmarked vehicle, that quickly takes you away from the party, and back toward the spaceport and your ship. Timothy's final words to you being that you should get off world as quickly as you can, and that he is sorry he invited you here.`

The crowd's excitement wanes and a smattering of lackluster applause punctuates the end of your speech.`

			`	You make small talk with various dignitaries. You even say a few words to Regina. Everyone is pleased to meet you, and few people ask for your autograph.`
			`	Finally, Timothy makes his way to you and takes you to a quieter room off to the side.`
			`	"Captain <last>, I hope you've found the night agreeable. Saga seems to be happy with the playmates I found for her, and I've noticed you have your fair share of fans here. I also wanted to let you know, that there is a sum of cash associated with tonight's reward. That you will be given 1 million credits, as gift from Rand, and more specifically, from me."`
			`	Timothy lifts his glass, "Just another way for me to thank you for saving me."`

You rent a vehicle and take yourself, and Caesar beyond the blighted city and out in the pleasant picture-perfect paradise of the wealthy. One princely estate after another rolls past you as you drive deeper into the rural domains of the Republic's super-wealthy. Eventually, you come across a large metal gate that reads, 'Mitchell Ranch'.`
			`	It's another 45 minutes of driving down long winding roads, past various out buildings, lodges, retreats, guest houses, and hobby barns, before at long last you arrive at the massive central mansion. Waiting at the bottom of stone stairs is a footman who opens the door for you, and summons the senior butler. `

Before exhaustion encroaches, and she lays down at your feet, tired, but gleeful.`

The Republic Navy made it easy. Enter their ships and be shipped off to paradise, to live as no ones at the sufferance of strangers."`
			`	Ildico tries to spit, and her eyes blaze, "But we were House Drifa. more than anyone else, we built this world, and we would not abandon it to be someone else's dredges. My father bought supplies, equipment, necessities from the Navy. Enough so that me, my brother, and my mother could survive here."`

He said all they needed was a little convincing, and that he would come back with the support to terraform, and save, Hope. And then... he never came back."`

			`	Before you know it the day has come to an end. Hjlod and you walk back down the beach where you find the kids laughing, giggling, and yelling happily around a bonfire. At the center of it all is Saga, who has been adopted as some sort of mascot, and looks happier than you've ever seen her.`

			`	Saga hesitates, she looks from you, to Svanhildr and back. She pushes out of your grasp, and walks over to the elated girl. She jumps up and licks Svanhildr on the face.`

The Eight other young women retreat to the side of the one of the bonfires and begin pulling something through the water. Beyond the fires the majority of Hrithfjell's townsfolk have arrived and watch the proceedings.`

				`	"Hjlod, why are all these people here? They couldn't have all known Saga. Why all this for my little dog?"`

			`	"But, you, Captain <last>, are loved by all here. Ve mourn for your pain. Saga vas your family, and you are ours."`
			`	Hjlod steps back to the shallow tide, and lifts her arms up to the crowd. She speaks easily in a guttural language unfamiliar to you, and the crowd responds with low chanting.`
			`	Behind Hjlod and Svanhildr, the other eight maidens have pulled up a small boat in waist high water. Svanhildr removes Saga from the wagon, and carriers to the boat.`
			`	The chanting grows louder, as Svanhildr leads the boat out into the dark evening waves, where it is swept out into the deep ocean, and the wild waters beyond.`
			`	The crowds chanting hits a crescendo, and at the moment the two bonfires are extinguished. The stars burn bright, their light reflected on the glassy waves, and the dark blot in the distance that is Saga disappears into night and foam.`
			`	In the darkness the crowd disperses, but a drenched Svanhildr finds you, and presses something cold and smooth into your hand. A stone.`
			`	"In Nifel, ve vould have let snow take remains. But here, ve follow the Ran's Folk tradition. But there is still the stone-rite, to honor her memory."`
			`	Svanhildr, lit by starlight, points toward a cliff up the beach. "Saga could not carve her memories into stone. So, I carved those who remember her. Take it up there, where old Ran's Folk cairns were built, and new Skadenga ones have begun."`
			`	With that Svanhildr leaves your side.`
			choice
				`	(Bring the stone to cairns.)`
			`	Beneath the starlight you make your way up the beach, and then around the cliff, to find the sacred scattered cairns of Ran's Folk and Skadenga.`
			`	The Ran's Folk cairns are obvious, as they are much larger with well worn family name plates that you can't make out in dim light. The Skadenga cairns, are mostly individual, or small piles of stones. Not really cairns yet. They represent new families formed here, often with the union of Ran Folk and Skadenga.`
			`	You see a small spot, overlooking the crashing waves below that you think Saga would have liked. You lift the stone up and read what has been carved upon it by Svanhildr.`
			`	"The day I was found by <first> <last>."`
			`	"The day I spent with Svanhildr playing on the beach."`
			`	"The friends I met along the way."`
			`	"All the things I made whole."`
			`	"The life I spent with <first> <last>."`
			`	You leave the stone there, and head back toward the town of Hrithfjell. Your friends are waiting, and you spend the night there in good company. You tell your own stories of Saga, and they listen.`
			`	When the morning comes, you bid farewell, and head back to your waiting ship.`
